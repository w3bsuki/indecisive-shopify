# Railway Root Directory Configuration

## The Issue
Railway is looking in `/backend` but your Medusa app is in `/backend/medusa-backend`

## Solution: Update Railway Settings

1. **Go to your Railway project dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Settings > General**
3. **Find "Root Directory" setting**
4. **Change from**: `/backend` or `.backend`
5. **Change to**: `backend/medusa-backend`
6. **Save the changes**

## Why This Works
- Your app structure is: `/backend/medusa-backend/package.json`
- Railway needs to know where to find package.json
- Setting root directory to `backend/medusa-backend` tells Railway exactly where your app is

## After Changing Root Directory
Railway will:
1. Look for package.json in `backend/medusa-backend/`
2. Find the nixpacks.toml and railway.json configs there
3. Run the build and start commands from the correct location

## Alternative: Environment Variable
If the UI doesn't allow changing, you can also set:
- Variable name: `NIXPACKS_ROOT_DIR`
- Value: `backend/medusa-backend`

This should trigger a new deployment with the correct configuration!
