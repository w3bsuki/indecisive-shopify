# ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 1 ULTRA-REFINED PLAN: Risk-Stratified Foundation
*Post-Intelligence Analysis | June 29, 2025*

## ðŸ§  INTELLIGENCE SYNTHESIS

After comprehensive subagent research, the original "upgrade everything" plan was **TOO RISKY**. Critical findings:

- **Tailwind 4.0**: Browser compatibility gap (Chrome 120+ required vs 111+ supported)
- **Next.js 15.3**: Turbopack is ALPHA (not production ready)
- **ESLint 9**: Safe upgrade but 27 existing errors need fixing first
- **Testing Stack**: Breaking changes in React Testing Library

## ðŸŽ¯ NEW STRATEGY: Risk-Stratified Execution

### PHASE 1A: ZERO-RISK FOUNDATION (Execute Immediately)
*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

#### Step 1A-1: Project Identity & Cleanup (15 mins)
```json
// package.json updates
{
  "name": "indecisive-wear-store",
  "description": "Modern Shopify headless storefront with Next.js 15",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/your-username/indecisive-wear-store"
  }
}
```

#### Step 1A-2: TypeScript 5.8.3 Upgrade (10 mins)
```bash
npm install -D typescript@5.8.3
# Benefits: 15-20% performance improvement, Node.js 22 ESM support
# Risk: ZERO (backward compatible)
```

#### Step 1A-3: Fix Existing ESLint Errors (25 mins)
```bash
# Current state: 27 errors, 5 warnings
# Must fix before ESLint 9 upgrade
npm run lint -- --fix  # Auto-fix what's possible
# Manual fixes needed:
# - 14 unused variables/imports
# - 6 explicit `any` types  
# - 6 unescaped entities in JSX
```

#### Step 1A-4: Clean Up Test Files (10 mins)
```bash
rm tests/hooks/use-cart-example.test.tsx  # Non-existent functionality
rm tests/utils/performance.test.ts        # Unused performance tests
rm hooks/use-hydrogen-cart.tsx            # Redundant wrapper
```

### PHASE 1B: LOW-RISK UPGRADES (Execute After 1A)
*Estimated Time: 2 hours*

#### Step 1B-1: Playwright 1.53.1 Upgrade (30 mins)
```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test@1.53.1
# Benefits: Describable locators, enhanced debugging
# Risk: LOW (minimal breaking changes)
```

#### Step 1B-2: ESLint 9 Migration (60 mins)
```bash
# Prerequisites: All ESLint errors fixed (from 1A-3)
npm install -D eslint@9.29.0 eslint-config-next@15.3.0

# Migrate to flat config (detailed in ESLINT_9_MIGRATION_REPORT.md)
mv .eslintrc.json .eslintrc.json.backup
# Create eslint.config.js with FlatCompat layer
```

#### Step 1B-3: React Testing Library 16.x (30 mins)
```bash
npm install -D @testing-library/react@16.3.0 @testing-library/dom@10.4.0
# Breaking change: @testing-library/dom now peer dependency
# Risk: MEDIUM (breaking changes documented)
```

### PHASE 1C: RESEARCH-REQUIRED DECISIONS (Don't Execute Yet)

#### Decision Point 1: Tailwind 4.0 Browser Compatibility
```bash
# REQUIRED: Check Google Analytics browser data
# Question: What % of users on Chrome 111-119?
# < 2%: Safe to proceed
# 2-5%: Proceed with caution
# > 5%: Delay upgrade

# IF APPROVED: Tailwind 4.0 migration
npm install tailwindcss@4.0.0 @tailwindcss/vite@next
# Replace @tailwind directives with @import "tailwindcss"
```

#### Decision Point 2: Next.js 15.3 Turbopack Strategy  
```bash
# TURBOPACK IS ALPHA - NOT PRODUCTION READY
# Options:
# A) Skip 15.3, wait for stable Turbopack
# B) Upgrade to 15.3, keep Webpack for production
# C) Test Turbopack in staging only

# Recommended: Option B (staged adoption)
npm install next@15.3.0
# Configure dual build system
```

- [ ] TypeScript 5.8.3 installed and working
- [ ] 0 ESLint errors (down from 27)
- [ ] Unused test files removed
- [ ] Build time baseline established

### Phase 1B Validation (Low Risk)

## ðŸš¨ ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Phase 1A Rollback (if needed)
```bash
git checkout -- package.json        # Restore original name
npm install -D typescript@5         # Downgrade TypeScript
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/         # Restore ESLint errors
```

- [ ] All Phase 1A + 1B complete and stable
- [ ] Phase 1C decisions made and executed (if approved)
- [ ] Full test suite passing
- [ ] Performance baseline established
- [ ] No regressions in production features

## ðŸ¤– ORCHESTRATION DECISION

**I WILL EXECUTE Phase 1A + 1B myself** (sequential, low-risk)
**I WILL ORCHESTRATE SUBAGENTS for Phase 1C** (parallel research needed)

---

**NEXT ACTION**: Execute Phase 1A immediately (zero risk, 1 hour)
**USER DECISION REQUIRED**: Browser analytics for Tailwind 4.0 compatibility
**BUSINESS IMPACT**: Minimal (foundation improvements only)
