# Order Management Implementation Guide

## Overview

The order management system is fully integrated with Shopify's Customer API, providing real-time order history and details.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Order History Page (`/account/orders`)
- Displays all customer orders with:
  - Order number and date
  - Order status (fulfillment + financial)
  - Total price with proper currency formatting
  - Number of items
  - First product image preview
- Color-coded status badges
- Links to detailed order view
- **NEW: Reorder functionality**

### ✅ Order Details Page (`/account/orders/[id]`)
- Complete order information:
  - All line items with images
  - Product variants (size, color)
  - Quantities and prices
  - Shipping address
  - Order totals (subtotal, shipping, tax)
- Order timeline with status indicators
- **NEW: Reorder all items button**

### ✅ Reorder Functionality
- One-click reorder from order history
- Adds all items from previous order to cart
- Handles out-of-stock gracefully
- Shows success toast with cart link

## Technical Implementation

### GraphQL Queries
```graphql
# Customer Orders Query
CUSTOMER_ORDERS_QUERY - Fetches paginated order list
CUSTOMER_ORDER_QUERY - Fetches single order details
```

### Server Actions
```typescript
// Get order data for reordering
getReorderDataAction(orderId: string)
```

### Components
- `ReorderButton` - Client component for cart interaction
- Order status utilities for formatting and colors

## Usage

### Viewing Orders
1. Customer must be logged in
2. Navigate to `/account/orders`
3. Click on any order to see details

### Reordering
1. Click "Reorder" button on any order
2. All items are added to cart
3. Toast notification confirms success
4. Optional: Click "View Cart" in toast

## Security

- All order data requires authenticated customer token
- Orders are filtered to show only customer's own orders
- Secure httpOnly cookies for session management

## Future Enhancements

### Order Tracking (Currently Disabled)
To enable tracking, modify GraphQL queries to include:
```graphql
fulfillments(first: 10) {
  trackingCompany
  trackingInfo {
    number
    url
  }
}
```

### Pagination
The GraphQL queries support cursor-based pagination. To implement:
1. Convert orders page to client component
2. Track cursor state
3. Load more orders on button click

### Order Filters
Add filtering by:
- Date range
- Order status
- Product categories

## Testing

1. **Order History**: Visit `/account/orders`
2. **Order Details**: Click any order number
3. **Reorder**: Click "Reorder" button
4. **Verify**: Check cart contains all items

## Performance

- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Optimized image loading
- Minimal client-side JavaScript
- Type-safe with full TypeScript coverage
