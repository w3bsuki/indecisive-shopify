# Next.js 15.3 Migration Report
## Shopify Headless Commerce Project

> **Migration Assessment**: Production-ready upgrade from Next.js 15.2.4 to 15.3 with Turbopack integration for Shopify headless commerce

---

## Executive Summary

Next.js 15.3 introduces **alpha Turbopack production builds** with significant performance improvements (28-83% faster builds) and better CPU core scaling. While the upgrade is technically feasible, **several compatibility considerations** exist for our Shopify Hydrogen React integration and deployment strategy.

### Key Findings
- ✅ **Performance**: Up to 83% faster builds with Turbopack on multi-core systems

1. **React Router 7 Migration**: Hydrogen 2025.5.0 migrated to React Router 7
2. **Architecture Differences**: Hydrogen uses Vite + React Router vs Next.js App Router
3. **Component Compatibility**: Framework-agnostic but may need adjustments

**Recommended Approach**:
```typescript
// Continue using Hydrogen React components selectively
import { ShopifyProvider, CartProvider } from '@shopify/hydrogen-react';

// Avoid full Hydrogen framework patterns
// Stick to component library usage
```

### 2.3 React 19 Considerations

**Known Issues**:
- Ref handling changes in some libraries
- Ant Design compatibility problems reported
- Enhanced Server Components support

**Our Impact**: Limited - using modern React patterns already

  // Enable Turbopack for development (stable)
  // Production builds require --turbopack flag
  
  turbopack: {
    // Loader configurations
    rules: {
      // SVG handling
      '*.svg': {
        loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],
        as: '*.js',
      },
      
      // Custom font handling if needed
      '*.woff2': {
        loaders: ['url-loader'],
        as: '*.js',
      },
    },
    
    // Module resolution
    resolveAlias: {
      '@': './src',
      '@/components': './components',
      '@/lib': './lib',
    },
  },
  
  // Experimental optimizations
  experimental: {
    optimizePackageImports: [
      '@radix-ui/react-icons',
      'lucide-react',
      '@shopify/hydrogen-react',
    ],
  },
}
```

### 4.2 Development vs Production

```bash
# Development (stable)
npm run dev  # Uses Turbopack by default in 15.3

# Production (alpha) - for testing only
next build --turbopack

# Production (stable) - current approach
npm run build  # Uses webpack
```

### 4.3 Bundle Analysis with Turbopack

```typescript
// package.json - Add Turbopack analysis
{
  "scripts": {
    "analyze:turbo": "ANALYZE=true next build --turbopack",
    "build:turbo": "next build --turbopack",
    "build:compare": "npm run build && npm run build:turbo"
  }
}
```

**Key Benefits**:
- Faster development builds with Turbopack
- Improved TypeScript performance
- Future-proofing for Turbopack stable release

**Critical Requirements**:
- Thorough testing of Shopify Hydrogen React integration
- Railway deployment validation
- Performance monitoring post-upgrade
- Rollback plan ready for immediate deployment

The upgrade path is clear, but execution should prioritize stability over cutting-edge features for our production e-commerce application.
