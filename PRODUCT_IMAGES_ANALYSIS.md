## Implementation Changes Made

### 1. Created `lib/shopify/hero-products.ts`
- New utility function `getHeroSlides()` that fetches real product images
- Fallback to curated Unsplash images if Shopify data unavailable
- Proper price formatting with Bulgarian Lev (BGN) support
- Smart filtering for products with featured images

### 2. Updated `components/layout/hero-2.tsx`
- Now dynamically loads product images from Shopify
- Shows loading state while fetching data
- Displays actual product prices when available
- Links directly to product pages for real products
- Fallback to collection page for curated images
- Debug indicator shows whether image is from product or curated

### 3. Key Features Added
- **Dynamic Image Loading**: Real product images from Shopify CDN
- **Smart Fallbacks**: High-quality curated images if no products available
- **Price Display**: Shows "FROM 25.00 лв." for actual products
- **Direct Links**: Hero buttons link to specific product pages
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicator while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if API fails

## Product Image Quality

All product images are hosted on Shopify's CDN and appear to be:
- **High Quality**: Professional product photography
- **Consistent Style**: All appear to be t-shirt/apparel designs
- **Good Resolution**: Suitable for hero carousel display
- **Fast Loading**: Served from Shopify's global CDN

## Recommendations

1. **Use Real Product Images**: The store has 8 high-quality product images that work great for the hero carousel
2. **Maintain Fallbacks**: Keep the curated Unsplash images as fallbacks for reliability
3. **Consider Image Optimization**: The Shopify images could benefit from URL parameters for different sizes
4. **Product Photography**: Consider adding more lifestyle/styled shots for better hero impact

## Technical Implementation

The hero carousel now:
- Fetches real products using the existing Shopify API
- Displays actual product names and prices
- Links to specific product pages
- Shows 5 slides maximum (can be configured)
- Prioritizes available products over out-of-stock items
- Has smart error handling and fallbacks

## Files Modified

1. `/lib/shopify/hero-products.ts` - New utility functions
2. `/components/layout/hero-2.tsx` - Updated hero component
3. Environment variables already configured in `.env.local`

The hero carousel now showcases real products instead of placeholder images, creating a more authentic and engaging shopping experience.
